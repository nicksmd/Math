##### 1. Why Gauss elimination does not change the null space of matrix A?

let M be the product of elementary matrixes of A.

- suppose $x \in N(A)$, so Ax = 0. we have:

  ​		$MAx = M(Ax) = M.0 = 0$

  so $x \in N(MA)$ as well.

- suppose $y \in N(MA)$, so (MA).y=0. we have:

  ​		$Ay = M^{-1} MAy = M^{-1}.0=0$

  so $y \in N(A)$ as well.

That means when you apply Gauss elimination, you do change the solution space. 

##### 2. Why every elementary is invertible?
